Fireworks Simulator
Marc Molta

Description:
Code for a fireworks simulator that can test the explosion time of five different fireworks. Each firework will explode at different times, according to their own internal fuse. You can adjust the launch angle, launch speed, trajectory color and firework type.

Warnings:
The GUI works best in the pre-determined screen size at launch or pretty much any screen size larger. It scales decently well, but for extremely small screens some of the controls will appear behind the main canvas. They are still usable. 


Using the GUI:
Slide the angle and launch speed to your desired setting (Trajectories and explosions are best viewed when the launch angle is above 20 degrees). Scroll through the four options for color, given in hex code. Scroll through the five available options for firework type. Once all the desired parameters are set, press run. The color of the trajectory is independent of the color of the explosion. The user determines the trajectory color, but the explosion color is preset.
