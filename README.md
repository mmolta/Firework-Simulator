Fireworks Simulator
Marc Molta


Warnings:
The GUI works best in the pre-determined screen size at launch or pretty much any screen size larger. It scales decently well, but for extremely small screens some of the 
controls will appear behind the main canvas. They are still usable. 


Using the GUI:
Slide the angle and launch speed to your desired setting (Trajectories and explosions are best viewed when the launch angle is above 20 degrees)
Scroll through the four options for color, given in hex code. Scroll through the five available options for firework type. I have the 
firework type spinner set so that it will only present options 1-5. Once all the desired parameters are set, press run. The color of the
trajectory is independent of the color of the explosion. The user determines the trajectory color, but the explosion color is preset.
